# Travilo 🌍✈️

**Travilo** is the foundational phase of a next-generation travel booking platform. Currently in the early stages of development, this project focuses on establishing a premium, high-fidelity mobile UI/UX using Flutter.

The goal is to build a scalable and immersive application that will eventually serve as a comprehensive travel companion, allowing users to discover destinations, book stays, and plan entire trips seamlessly.

## � Project Vision

We are building the groundwork for a "Big App" that combines:
- **Immersive Discovery**: Visually stunning interfaces for exploring worldwide destinations.
- **Seamless Booking**: Future integration for hotels, tours, and flights.
- **Personalized Experience**: A user-centric design that adapts to individual preferences.

## 📱 Current Progress (UI Foundation)

At this stage, we have implemented the core responsive UI architecture:
- **Responsive Design System**: Custom responsive widgets that adapt to various screen sizes using `MediaQuery` and `LayoutBuilder`.
- **Modern Dark Theme**: A consistent, sleek dark aesthetic (`#101922`) designed for visual comfort and premium feel.
- **Home Dashboard**: A dynamic landing page showcasing featured destinations, hotels, and local culture (food/weather).
- **Trips Exploration**: An interactive "Where to next?" interface for searching and browsing travel categories.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) (Focusing on UI/UX capabilities)
- **Language**: [Dart](https://dart.dev/)
- **Architecture**: Scalable MVVM structure ready for future business logic integration.

## 📂 Structure

The project is structured to support scaling:
```text

├── core/           # Shared utilities, styles, and responsive helpers
├── features/       # Feature-based modular architecture (Home, Trips, Auth)
└── main.dart       # App entry point
```
